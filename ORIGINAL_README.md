## Installation

### Development installation

* [On the host operating system with Chef Solo](doc/development.md) (on metal it will run much faster than inside a VM)

* [On a virtual machine with Vagrant](doc/development_vagrant.md)

### Production installation

* [On the host operating system with Chef Solo](doc/production.md)

* [On Amazon Web Services (AWS) with Vagrant](doc/aws_vagrant.md)

If you want to do a production installation using AWS Opsworks please see the [cookbook for GitLab on AWS Opsworks repository](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/cookbook-gitlab-opsworks/blob/master/README.md).

## Recipes

### clone

Clones the GitLab repository. Recipe uses the attributes in `attributes/default.rb` and, depending on the environment set,
`attributes/development.rb` or `attributes/production.rb`.

### database_mysql

Use to setup mysql database. Available attributes are listed in `attributes/default.rb`.

### database_posgresql

Use to setup postgresql database. Available attributes are listed in `attributes/default.rb`.

### default

Default recipe, it includes two recipes: `setup` and `deploy`. Default recipe is being used to do the complete GitLab installation.

### deploy

Used to clone, configure, setup and start a GitLab instance. `deploy` recipe can be used with AWS OpsWorks to deploy GitLab to an instance.
To use with AWS OpsWorks:

1. Use a preset `Rails App Server` layer or create a custom one
1. Edit the layer
1. Under section `Custom Chef Recipes` and `Deploy` fill in `gitlab::deploy` and save

NOTE: Must be used in combination with `gitlab::setup` recipe.

### gems

This recipe decides what will be included and what will be omitted from the bundle install command and then it runs the bundle install.
Inclusion or exclusion is decided based on the database selected and environment, using attributes in `attributes/default.rb`

### git

Installs packages required for git and compiles it from source. Uses attributes provided in `attributes/git.rb`.

### gitlab_shell_clone

Clones the gitlab-shell repository. Recipe uses the attributes in `attributes/default.rb` and, depending on the environment set,
`attributes/development.rb` or `attributes/production.rb`.

### gitlab_shell_install

Creates a gitlab-shell config.yml from attributes in `attributes/default.rb` and, depending on the environment set,
`attributes/development.rb` or `attributes/production.rb`. Runs `gitlab-shell` install script and install it.

### install

Creates a gitlab config.yml, database.yml from attributes in `attributes/default.rb` and, depending on the environment set,
`attributes/development.rb` or `attributes/production.rb`. Creates GitLab required directories and sets permissions. Copies the example files
to their locations. Runs `db:setup`, `db:migrate`, `db:seed_fu` to prepare selected database for GitLab.

### nginx

### ruby

## Testing the cookbook

First install the necessary gems

```bash
bundle install

To check for syntax errors run foodcritic:

```bash
foodcritic .

```
